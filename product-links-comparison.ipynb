language models, also known as efficient language models or compact language models, are AI models that are designed to be faster and more compact than traditional language models while still maintaining their ability to generate high-quality text responses. The importance of fast language models cannot be overstated, as they have numerous applications in various industries, leading to significant economic and social benefits. Here are some reasons why fast language models are important:\n\n1. **Scalability**: Fast language models can be deployed on low-power devices, such as smartphones, watches, or smart home devices, without compromising on performance. This enables widespread adoption and convenience for users.\n2. **Real-time applications**: Fast language models can process and generate text in real-time, making them ideal for applications like chatbots, virtual assistants, and language translation services.\n3. **Efficient computing resources**: Fast language models require fewer computing resources than traditional language models, making them more suitable for edge computing, cloud computing, and embedded systems.\n4. **Cost-effective**: Fast language models are often more cost-effective than traditional language models, as they require less data storage, processing power, and energy consumption.\n5. **Faster training**: Fast language models can be trained faster than traditional language models, which enables them to keep pace with the rapidly evolving nature of language and adapt to new tasks more quickly.\n6. **Improved user experience**: Fast language models can respond quickly and accurately, enhancing the user experience in applications like customer service chatbots, language translation apps, and voice assistants.\n7. **Enhanced accessibility**: Fast language models can be used to provide language translation and text-to-speech capabilities to people with disabilities, such as those who are deaf or hard of hearing.\n8. **Increased productivity**: Fast language models can assist professionals in various fields, such as writing, editing, and research, by providing rapid and accurate language processing capabilities.\n9. **Improved data compression**: Fast language models can compress data more efficiently than traditional language models, which reduces storage requirements and improves data transfer rates.\n10. **Driven innovation**: The development of fast language models will drive innovation in AI, NLP, and related fields, leading to breakthroughs in areas like computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing.\n\nIn summary, fast language models are essential for achieving scalability, real-time processing, and cost-effectiveness in various applications, which has significant implications for multiple industries and society as a whole.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":5},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from groq import Groq\n\nclient = Groq(api_key=GROQ_API_KEY)\ncompletion = client.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"llama-3.2-11b-vision-preview\",\n    messages=[\n        {\n            \"role\": \"user\",\n            \"content\": [\n                {\n                    \"type\": \"text\",\n                    \"text\": \"Fetch the product links for the product in the image?\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"type\": \"image_url\",\n                    \"image_url\": {\n                        \"url\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/LPU-v1-die.jpg\"\n                    }\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    ],\n    temperature=1,\n    max_tokens=1024,\n    top_p=1,\n    stream=False,\n    stop=None,\n)\n\nprint(completion.choices[0].message)\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-12-02T00:57:51.341305Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-12-02T00:57:51.341915Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-12-02T00:57:52.641438Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-12-02T00:57:51.341877Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-12-02T00:57:52.640598Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"ChatCompletionMessage(content=\"I'm not able to access real-time information on the internet, so I cannot fetch the product links for the specific product in the image.
